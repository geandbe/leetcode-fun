### The Contents
**leetcode-fun** is a collection of solutions to some of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems
given in Functional Programming style.

### Motivation
Functional Programming has gained some traction recently in industry, education, and research. Despite modern
programming languages were extended by functional programming facilities (e.g. Java), or were originally designed 
functional programming-centric (e.g. F#), the paradigm itself does not make it to the mainstream yet. Evidently,
attempts to ignite interest to the LeetCode problems solved functionally are met quite coldly.
This may reflect the specifics of LeetCode audience due to the low correlation with the coding interview success. I'm
curious to find out with this project if the interest from wider masses is low, indeed.


### Why Polyglot?
Programming languages used to implement the solutions may include _Python 3_, _Kotlin_, and _F#_.
Such polyglot approach would allow illustrating and illuminating the Functional Programming ways and patterns, being
expressed side by side in idiomatic not functional first Python, functional friendly Kotlin, and functional first F#.
I do believe that such comparative study of solutions would allow interested public to fully embrace the functional
paradigm and acquire a new valuable skill distinguishing them from the rest of the crowd.

### Usage
I'm not active in social media since 2014 and do not aim to make this project popular through blogging and such.
I will go at my own pace time permitting, although at the moment I have a private repo having functional solutions to
around 200 of LeetCode problems and counting that are implemented in Python 3. I will make some of those public here
complementing by Kotlin and/or F# implementations and adding explanations and comments.
